## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

## Project: Student Grade Tracker

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Python-based system that allows users to track and manage student grades. The system should enable users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade and GPA.

## Key Features

- **Student Profile Management:** The system allows users to create and manage student profiles, including their names and grades.
- **Grade Input and Management:** Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments, and the system will store and manage these grades.
- **Average Grade Calculation:** The system calculates the average grade based on the input grades.
- **Grade Display:** The system displays the student's grades, average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

## Functional Requirements

- The system should allow users to create and manage student profiles.
- The system should enable users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
- The system should calculate the average grade based on the input grades.
- The system should display the student's grades, average grade, and GPA.

## Technical Requirements

- The system should be developed using Python programming language.
- The system should use a suitable data structure to store and manage student grades.

## Benefits
